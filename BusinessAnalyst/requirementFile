Requirement: Deploy Rasa chatbot on Docker and AWS

Background:
Our company has developed a Rasa chatbot for customer support, and we need to deploy it to a production environment. We have decided to use Docker containers to ensure consistency and portability across environments, and AWS as our cloud provider to ensure scalability and reliability.

Scope:
This requirement covers the deployment of the Rasa chatbot on Docker and AWS, as well as the necessary infrastructure and configuration.

Acceptance Criteria:

The Rasa chatbot is deployed on Docker containers, with separate containers for the Rasa server and action server.
The Docker containers are built using a Dockerfile that includes all the necessary dependencies and configuration files.
The Docker containers are tested locally to ensure that the chatbot functions as expected.
The Docker containers are pushed to a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub or AWS ECR.
The Rasa chatbot is deployed on AWS using ECS (Elastic Container Service) or EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).
The necessary AWS infrastructure, such as VPC, subnets, security groups, and IAM roles, are set up.
The Docker containers are deployed to AWS using the appropriate ECS or EKS resources and configurations.
The deployed Rasa chatbot is tested to ensure that it functions as expected in the production environment.
The deployment process is documented and shared with the team for future reference.
Dependencies:

A working Rasa chatbot with trained models and actions.
Docker installed on the deployment machine.
Access to a Docker registry, such as Docker Hub or AWS ECR.
An AWS account with permissions to create and manage necessary resources.
Knowledge of Docker, AWS, and Rasa deployment and configuration
